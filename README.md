# Selected Leetcodes
Not all, but some leetcodes that I did and found them interesting would be added here with explanation

## Leetcode 489 - Hard
Initially thought that it has to be an A* or other shortest path but first tried a DFS and it was the solution.
The challenge is to be careful with backtracking and the direction after returns. Also, budgetting eough space for the 2D vectors twice the max size, because the initial location is unknown and max direction could come from either side
