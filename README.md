# Selected Leetcodes
Not all, but some leetcodes that I did and found them interesting would be added here with explanation.
If you had questions please contact me.

## Leetcode 489 - Hard
Initially thought that it has to be an A* or other shortest path but first tried a DFS and it was the solution.
The challenge is to be careful with backtracking and the direction after returns. Also, budgetting eough space for the 2D vectors twice the max size, because the initial location is unknown and max direction could come from either side

## Leetcode 568 - Hard
Relatively complicated Problem and the solution based in Dynamic Programming.

## Leetcode 2251 - Hard
Very intersting problem that I solved in one of weekly contests. The problem seems easy to understand. 
The solution is based on binary search. Need to find the flowers that are too late and also flowers. And then find the ones that are too early. There are some comments in the file also

## Leetcode 815 - Bus Routes - Hard
Usual Breadth First Search (BFS) type of problem. The tricky part was that initially you are not in any bus and need to push all possible bus optioins into the queue and mark those buses as taken.
